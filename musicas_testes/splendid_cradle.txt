The ground is falling apart
We are afraid to fly around
We have got nowhere to run to
We have got no fate to hold on to
Our leaders have blinded our nation
We are no longer free!
Corruption has brought more and more frustration
Eternally lying in a splendid cradle
And eternally blinded
It keeps me away from the entire world
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
I don't wanna laugh about my tragedy
I don't wanna feel this pain no more
Shame on those who just care about their own souls
Our world will just vanish in the air
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
We want to live in harmony
I want to wake up from this bad dream
